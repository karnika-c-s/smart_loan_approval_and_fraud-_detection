# 🏦 Smart Loan Approval & Fraud Detection System

**Smart Loan Approval & Fraud Detection System** is an interactive tool that helps financial institutions make smarter lending decisions. By analyzing applicant details and transaction behavior, the system predicts whether a loan should be approved and flags potentially fraudulent applications. It features a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions and provides insights into the key factors influencing each decision.


## ✨ Features

- Interactive UI with **Streamlit**
- Real-time **loan approval prediction**
- Fraud detection using transaction behavior
- **Model explainability** with SHAP
- Visual analysis using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
- Machine learning using **Scikit-learn** and **XGBoost**


## 📊 Data Description

- **Loan Application Data**: Includes applicant demographics, income, loan purpose, credit score, etc.
- **Transaction Data**: Includes customer transaction types, frequency, amount, failure rate, and international transaction count.

The two datasets are merged using `customer_id` to create a consolidated training dataset.
